# Advent-of-Code-2022
I'm interested in Machine Learning/Deep Learning and I already know well Python so I decided to learn Julia during Advent of Code 2022.


Day 1:
Did the 1st but I created the resporitory the 3rd
It was my first program in Julia, so I took time to open and parse the input.
I understood that in Julia we can use function on array like sum or map as we use in javascript.
I learn that the functions with a ! are "in place functions".

Day 2:
Did the 2nd but I created the resporitory the 3rd
I used dictonary to solve the problem.
It works well so I didn't have difficulties.

Day 3:
Did the 3rd
I used again dictonary.
I had a problem with Char: '' and String : "" which are not the same type -> I used  only() to convert a String to a Char.
I understood that we cannot index an array with a float despite it is 1.0 , 2.0 , ect...

Day 4:
Did the 4th
I made use of mathematical operator of julia on set (inclusion and intersection)
It is very efficient so I solved the problem in few lines
I enjoy more and more function like filter or map

Day 5:
Did the 5th but I forgot to push it
I used array to stock the columns, the function push! and pop! 
To do the second part I just put a I just added a stack that I filled and then emptied.
This challenge was cool the main difficuty was to extract the data
